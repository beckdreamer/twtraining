I'm a feminist, I believe in girl's power.

Currently, I'm studying for my master's degree in Nanyang Technology University in Singpaore.

Today's mood: 
    
    This year, I'm gonna have my first Chinese New Year away from my parents, which frustrates me, espesially it is my tiger year.
    Anyway, Happy New YearÔºÅStay health and safe!
    

At a age of 23, I do not dream big, but I make big wish.
My New Year wish is that the permanent cure for COVID can be invented, we can overcome the annoying pandemic and see each other's face in the near future.
